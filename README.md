# Docify

## Problem Statement
Docify is a decentralized, transparent and tamper proof application for document verification with polygon ID. The objective is to convert the zero knowledge proof from polygon ID to soul bound tokens. The application makes use of blockchain to transition from paper certificate to digital verifiable certificates.

### Techs we have used
* We have used Lens protocol to create the profile of user (Profile NFT)
* We have used Post functions to list the offerings from other enterprises users
* Polygon ID for creating zero knowledge proof for KYC which is required for enterprices application
* Biconomy SDK to provide walletless login to less tech-savy users.
